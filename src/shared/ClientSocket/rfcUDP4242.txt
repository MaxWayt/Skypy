                    Babel  communication protocol

Abstract
    This document describes how the RType Protocol session is mapped
    onto a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. And another
    User Datagram Protocol (UDP) connection to manage client
    communication.

Status of this Memo

    This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
    the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
    for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
    "Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
    standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution

RFC 4242            RType communication protocol            October 2013

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1.    Conventions Used in This Document

    The key words "INVITE", "ACK", "CANCEL", "BYE", "OPTIONS", "REGISTER"
    , "INFO" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
    [RFC3261].

    After being now successfully connected to the server, the client will
    have access to his contact list.

Make a call
    Mapping Babel session management facilities onto the UDP service is
    straightfoward. An Babel session first requires creation of a UDP
    connection between two peers, one that initiates the connection
    request and one that responds to the connection request. The
    initialising peer is called the "client", and the responding peer is
    called the "server".

    The client will first send an "INVITE" call to the server using an UDP
    socket. This Invite packet MUST have the following structure:

    <FLAGS_FIELD><COMMAND><0x9><USER_NAME@USER_ADRESS><0x9>
    <CONTACT_NAME@CONTACT_ADRESS>

    this will be in this case

    RINVITE	 toto@192.168.1.11	titi@192.168.1.10

    Note: Here 0x9 is replaced by tabulations

    where:
    <FLAGS_FIELD> Request/Response flag (R = request, r = response)
    <COMMAND> is the command name. Here is the command list:
    INVITE: Indicates a client is being invited to participate in a call session.
    ACK: Confirms that the client has received a final response to an INVITE request.
    BYE: Terminates a call and can be sent by either the caller or the callee.
    CANCEL: Cancels any pending request.
    MESSAGE: Transports instant messages using SIP.
    <USER_NAME> is the caller (client) name
    <USER_ADRESS> is the caller (client) adresS
    <SERVER_ADRESS> is the current server adress
    <CONTACT_NAME> is the name of the contact you are trying to join
    <CONTACT_ADRESS> is the adress of the contact you are trying to join

    The server will respond with a "TRYING" respond, wich mean that he is
    currently trying to join the contact. This respond will have the
    following structure:

    <FLAGS_FIELD><REPONSE_CODE><COMMAND><0x9><USER_ADRESS><0x9>
    <CONTACT_NAME@CONTACT_ADRESS>

    r100INVITE	  toto@192.168.1.11	titi@192.168.1.10

    the <REPONSE_CODE> flag is limited by the following codes:
    <100> = Trying
    <200> = Ok
    <487> = Request canceled
    <404> = Not found
    <180> = Ringing

    If the server reach the contact he will now respond using a "RINGING"
    packets.

    r180RINGING	  toto@192.168.1.11	titi@192.168.1.10

    Otherwise he will throw a 404 packet. This will mean that the contact
    you are trying to join is currently unreachable.

    r404NOTFOUND   toto@192.168.1.11	titi@192.168.1.10

    If the contact accept the call he will now respond an "OK" packets:

    r100OK   toto@192.168.1.11	titi@192.168.1.10
